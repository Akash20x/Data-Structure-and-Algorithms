// * ALGORITHM ==>
// * This question is not a dynamic programming problem because of the constraints which are given in the question. Infact it is application of DFS algorithm in 2-D grid.
// * We just traverse the 2-D array and call our max_gold_path function on every cell which do not contain a '0'. We make four recursive calls, in four direction and maintain a base case such that it can prevent segmentation fault, making a call on visited cell and visiting a cell containing '0'.
// * We also maintain a visited 2-D matrix to mark cells visited, so they don't get visited again.

// * Solution class
class Solution
